# tweet-bot

Node.js Twitter bot

## WIP

> For now, the bot read from a JSON file, send a random tweet and save it as **posted**.

## Configuration

- Fill your app credentials (https://apps.twitter.com) in `config.json` and you're done
- Run `test` for credentials check (see **test** section below)

## Usage

> Warning: You have to modify your app permissions to _Read and write_

- Run `npm install`
- Write a bunch of tweets in `to_tweet.json`
- Run `node index.js` and just be lazy :)

## Test

- Simply as `npm test`

## TODO

- Read from mongoDB ? (maybe one day)

## Contribution

- Open a ticket and let's work together !
